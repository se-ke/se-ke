# Hi, I'm Sean👋
I am a software engineer based out of Boston,
and I'm currently working as a software development engineer at Amazon Robotics.
Before joining Amazon Robotics, I studied computer science and information ethics at
Northeastern University, which I graduated from in May 2023.
In addition to my experience at Amazon Robotics, I also worked as a backend engineer at a
small social media startup called ListHall. I've also worked as a graphics development co-op
at Ansys and as a technology research analyst at Accenture Labs.
Outside of computing, I enjoy running, rock climbing, and learning to play the guitar.
