# Hi, I'm Sean👋
I am a software engineer based out of Boston, Massachusetts. Currently, I'm working as a backend engineer at an early-stage social media startup and studying computer science with a minor in information ethics at Northeastern University. Starting in January 2022, I will be working as a Software Development Engineer Co-op at Amazon Robotics. In the past, I have also worked as a graphics developer at Ansys and as a Technology Research Analyst at Accenture Labs. Outside of computing, I enjoy hiking, cooking, and learning to play the piano.

<!--I also love to travel and explore new places, so I am open to opportunities outside of my current locale.-->
