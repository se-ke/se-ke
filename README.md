# Hi, I'm Sean👋
I am a software engineer and undergraduate student based out of Boston, Massachusetts. Currently, I'm studying computer science with a minor in information ethics at Northeastern University with an expected graduation of May 2023. Most recently, I worked as a software development co-op at Amazon Robotics. Before working at Amazon Robotics, I worked as a backend engineer at a small social media startup called ListHall. I've also worked as a graphics development co-op at Ansys and as a technology research analyst at Accenture Labs. Outside of computing, I enjoy hiking, cooking, and learning to play the guitar. I also love to travel and explore new places, so I am open to opportunities outside of my current locale.
